# Personality-Chatbot


## Description

This project is a Telegram bot integrated with OpenAI's GPT API, designed to engage in conversations with users. The bot handles user messages, stores conversation history in a SQLite database, and dynamically generates responses using AI. The project is built using Python, leveraging libraries such as python-telegram-bot for Telegram API interaction, SQLAlchemy for ORM, and FastAPI for optional webhook-based deployment.
